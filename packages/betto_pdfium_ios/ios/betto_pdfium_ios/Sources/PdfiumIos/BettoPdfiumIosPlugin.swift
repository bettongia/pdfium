/// No-op Flutter plugin class for `betto_pdfium_ios`.
///
/// This plugin's only purpose is to carry the SPM dependency chain
/// PdfiumIos → PdfiumAnchor → pdfium_binary, which causes Xcode to
/// statically link the PDFium xcframework into the host app binary.
/// There is no method channel, no event channel, and no platform
/// interaction beyond registration.
///
/// `PdfDocument` in `betto_pdfium` calls `DynamicLibrary.process()` on
/// iOS, which resolves PDFium C API symbols from the process image after
/// the static link.
public class BettoPdfiumIosPlugin: NSObject, FlutterPlugin {
    /// Registers this plugin with the Flutter engine.
    ///
    /// This is a no-op — no channels are set up. The registration call
    /// is required by the Flutter plugin protocol and is invoked
    /// automatically by the generated plugin registrant in the host app.
